The Firefox @ AIUB community is relatively a new Firefox Club, in fact
it isn't actually a registered club yet. Our idea is to be objective
than being subjective and we found that if we had the AIUB authority
supporting us, then registering as a club is not the most important
thing at this moment. Thus we started our journey to spread the
philosophy of Open Web and Open Source in our campus :D

On a small adda, almost two months ago, someone proposed we have a
Webmaker event. Since most of us have very little idea about how
actually websites work, the proposal was greeted with mass appraisal :)
We talked to our honorable faculties and after many days of planning
arranged [Intro to Web - A Webmaker
event](http://www.facebook.com/events/203313443175367/ "Intro to Web - A Webmaker event").
And it was a blast! :D :D All thanks goes to Saef sir for guiding us
through the whole event!

We had no prior experience in event organizing, so we did some rigorous
planning before this one. And it paid us well \^\_\^ We even had plan B,
plan C in case of emergencies which actually occurred! When three of our
Mozillian attendees couldn't make it to the event, we triggered our back
up plan and improvised with anything else. Personally, I am grateful
that my teammates are so awesome that we had almost all the ends tied up
:)

Around 2 PM when half of the computer lab was full and we were still
copying local version of Thimble, Mr. Mashiour Rahman, Assistant
Professor and Head, Computer Science, dropped in to see our progress! We
did ask our honorable teacher to visit us in his free time but this was
so unexpected! Mashiour sir even gave a short speech, which was truly
inspiring for us :)

Anam started with a introduction to Mozilla. He explained why Mozilla is
concerned about the Open Web and why we should care. Then he gave a
short review of Mozilla Bangladesh community's activities to date.
Afterwards Anam transcended in and out after sessions. A few
participants had some questions about Mozilla and it's activities, Anam
explained those nicely :)

After that Sharif came with X-ray Goggles :D We started with X-ray
Goggles because with this cool tool the participants will be able to get
a clear view of how websites are constructed.

After Sharif, Rifaz came forward with Mozilla Thimble. The participants
were eagerly waiting for this one because this is when they get to try
out their newly learned coding skills :D

Now that the participants had two tools under their belt, we gave them
some time to get creative and build something :D

Around 5 PM when we were at the end of the event the speakers also
received some gift packs from AIUB. We gifted lanyards to our honorable
faculties.
