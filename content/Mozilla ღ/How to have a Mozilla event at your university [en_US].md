So you have got selected for [Firefox Student Ambassadors
program](http://minhazratul.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/become-firefox-student-ambassador/ "Be a Firefox Student Ambassador (Bangla)")?
And already opened a Firefox club at your very own campus? :D Yay!
Congratulations! Now the real work begins :D

As a beginner, you, the Firefox Club, can organize a number of events
that don’t require extensive experience at event management. One of
them, and my personal favorite is the
[Webmaker](http://minhazratul.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/intro-to-web-a-webmaker-event-at-aiub/ "Intro to Web – A Webmaker event at AIUB").
Search it on the web and Mozilla’s wiki for more information.

**STEP 1:**

After establishing your Club and discussing the type of event with your
fellow Ambassadors, the first thing you need to do is let your local
Mozilla community (Mozilla Bangladesh in this case) know your
intentions. You can ask for suggestions and advices in our Facebook
groups: [Mozilla
Bangladesh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MozillaBD/ "Mozilla Bangladesh")
and [Firefox Student Ambassadors,
Bangladesh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fsabd/ "Firefox Student Ambassadors, Bangladesh").
When you have got a clear view of  the plan, send an email to the local
Mozilla community’s mailing list
([community-bangladesh](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-bangladesh " community-bangladesh Info Page")).

**STEP 2:**

By now you have got okay sign from community members, plus one or more
[ReMo](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo "ReMo - MozillaWiki") are ready to
help your out :D Good job. I take that you explained every part of your
plan and adjusted it as other Mozillians suggested. Now you need to find
someone at your university who can get you the permission from authority
to arrange the event. You can go to-

-   The Office of Student Affairs

-   President of your university’s IT related club

-   A super-enthusiastic faculty

Explain your plan to them too. They too would have some suggestion and
advice, revise your plan accordingly.

**STEP 3:**

You have let both the ends know about what you want to do. Now it is
time to get official. You need to send a proposal letter through email
or as a printed copy (ask your contact which is better) to your
university authority. It might be the Head of the Department, an
Executive Officer at Office of Student Affairs, or a Faculty in charge
of these activities. You can find a demo proposal letter from asking at
Mozilla Bangladesh communication channels. Ask on the mailing list
thread about any confusion. Add the necessary details to your proposal
letter:

-   Topic of the event

-   Duration and date

-   Speakers and sessions

-   Target audience and estimated participants

-   Necessary resources- auditorium, projector, speaker etc.

-   Advertisement- booths, banners and posters.

You are all set to send the letter :)

Note: Try to fix a date for the event after at least 6 weeks from the
confirmation of your proposal. In that way we can ensure swags and have
plenty of time to plan in details.

**STEP 4:**

You have all sorts of permissions for your activities. It is high time
you had planned the details. Get a few experienced Mozillians to help
you out in this. They might also be the ones taking sessions in this
event, or they can suggest who can. You need to-

-   Fix segments for the sessions and gap between them.

-   Decide how to distribute swags

-   Always have plan B, C, even D in case of emergency

-   Select some of your finest as volunteers/facilitator

-   A photographer friend or someone from the Photography Club for
    awesome photo memories

**STEP 5:**

It's time for the event :D Check if everything is okay a day before the
event. Remember to-

-   Check your task list/planning page
-   Keep the next speaker and their instruments ready
-   Put the volunteers on the move so that they can help the
    participants
-   Distribute swags carefully
-   Be careful with food (if you plan to give refreshments)
-   Take lots and lots of photos
-   And have tons of fun :D

**STEP 6:**

I hope the event was a success :D Congratulations you and your awesome
mates! Not time to sit back yet :P You have to share your amazing
experience with us!

-   Post on Facebook/Google+/Twitter with the FSA page attached with it
-   Write a blog post :D with the great photos!
-   Upload the photos to the Mozilla Bangladesh Flickr group
-   Email all the links to the mailing list thread!

Aaaaaand you are done! Hope to see more and more events :D

Thanks to my buddy another Mozillian
[Tanha](http://tanhaislampinkdevil.wordpress.com/) for reminding me to
write a step by step guide :) True that not every event will follow
these steps, but it will help to get some idea of where to start.
