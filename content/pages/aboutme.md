Summary: A little bit about me

Hi! I am Ratul from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I was born and raised here, currently
working my way through undergrad. I am a
[Mozillian](http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/). Like my fellow Mozillians, I
believe in a Open Web where anyone can create and share. I usually attend
programmes in university campuses and work on engagement. I am an Actioneer,
that is, a member of [CommunityAction](http://ca-bd.org). It is a small student
run volunteer NGO. Our slogan is \u2018Even a Smile is Charity\u2019. I do
mainly field work and project manegement for our different Actions. These
organizations are my life :) With one, I fight for the opennes, and with
another, I try to heal the weeping hearts. Other than my volunteer works I have
a number of hobbies: coding, reading books and manga, indoor gardening,
travelling and a lot other things! Feel free to contact me through
[email](mailto:minhaz.ratul@gmail.com) :) I almost reply to all of my mails.
